# DataWrangling_Netflix
Data wrangling using Python is an important techical skill that a Junior Data Engineer should know.

In this mini project on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Data Cleaning and Data Visualization where I will be using the dataset "netflix_titles.csv" 
to do some data wrangling.Â¶

I have used the various python libraries such as Pandas for EDA and data cleaning, and showcasing the various data using Matplotlib, Matrix Seaborn and Plotly Express 
for data visualization.

I have learned a lot during this project, and will continue to fine-tune the project as well as work on other projects in the near future.
